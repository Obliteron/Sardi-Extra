Sardi consists of 6 major icon themes and 10 different kind of folders.

You can change all icon themes with the words **flexible** and **colora** in them.
Sardi comes with many coloring scripts. You can color the icons any way you see fit.

These icons are an example what you can do with the Sardi icons.

These are all scripting results of the Sardi icons. They will be updated together with the sardi icons.
But as such they are not part of the sardi core.

You can make more icon themes by using the other colour combinations and the scripts. 

IF you want to try them then 

copy/paste the folders in your ./icons folder.



Have fun.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
