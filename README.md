# Sardi Extras

These icons are the result of the many scripting possibilities in Sardi icons to be downloaded at sourceforge.

Articles are to be found http://www.erikdubois.be.

These are all scripting results of the Sardi icons. They were made at some point in time. They are not part of the sardi core.
You can remake them by using the same colouring and the scripts. They will not be updated.

IF you want to try them then 

copy/paste the folders in your ./icons folder.

Have fun.

# F  A  Q
--------------------

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename

Or you can follow these steps
