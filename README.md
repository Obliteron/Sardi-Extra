# Sardi Extras

These icons are the result of the many scripting possibilities in Sardi icons to be downloaded at sourceforge.

Articles are to be found http://www.erikdubois.be.

These are all scripting results of the Sardi icons. They were made at some point in time. They are not part of the sardi core.
You can remake them by using the same colouring and the scripts. They will not be updated.

IF you want to try them then 

copy/paste the folders in your ./icons folder.

Have fun.
